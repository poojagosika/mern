</body>


<h1>The highest heading with bigger size </h1>
We need to use h1 only once while creating a website
Ctr1 1 – 2 3 4 switched each tab u want 

alt tab switches tabs
Ctrl 0 enables u to comes back to the original tab size 100
When live server is closed, click alt l o then we can closed live server

<br> tag breaks the statement and comes to new line
We don’t use opening n closing tag for br, only single tag can be used for br
Alt is the value and any link is the attribute which means anything in double quotes is an attribute
